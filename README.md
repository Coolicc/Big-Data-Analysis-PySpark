# Big-Data-Analysis-PySpark

Collection of my student project and homework solutions for Big Data Analisys course at Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad. The code is written in Python in the form of Google Colaboratory notebooks, using PySpark as the main engine used for the distributed data analisys as well as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. In the project I used a dataset of interactions of users across subreddits and tried to see how those subreddits are connected, how are they grouped and what do they have in common.
